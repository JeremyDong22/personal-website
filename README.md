## Setting Up the Contact Form with EmailJS

The contact form is configured to use EmailJS to send emails directly from the client-side without needing a backend server. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Create a free account at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create a new Email Service in your EmailJS dashboard (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Create a new Email Template with the following variables:
   - `user_name`: The name of the person contacting you
   - `user_email`: The email of the person contacting you
   - `subject`: The subject of the message
   - `message`: The content of the message
4. Get your EmailJS credentials:
   - Service ID: Found in the "Email Services" section
   - Template ID: Found in the "Email Templates" section
   - Public Key: Found in the "Account" section
5. Update the `src/components/ContactForm.js` file with your credentials:
   ```javascript
   const serviceId = 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID';
   const templateId = 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID';
   const publicKey = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY';
   ```

Once configured, the contact form will send emails to the address you specified in your EmailJS template whenever someone submits the form.
