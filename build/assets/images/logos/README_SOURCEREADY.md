# Source Ready Logo Fix

If the Source Ready logo is not displaying correctly, please follow these steps:

1. Find the Source Ready company logo online
2. Save it as `sourceready.png` in this directory
3. Make sure the image has a transparent background
4. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger

## Alternative Solution

If you can't find the Source Ready logo, you can create a simple placeholder:

1. Use a tool like Canva or Adobe Express to create a simple logo
2. Create a square image with the text "SR" or "Source Ready"
3. Use the company's brand colors if known
4. Save as PNG with transparent background
5. Name it `sourceready.png` and place in this directory

The website is configured to automatically use this logo when it's available.
